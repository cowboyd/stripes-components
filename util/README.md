This `util` area contains utility functions, whereas `../lib` contains utility components.

    * [Parameters](#parameters)


## this.transitionToParams(params)

Must be invoked with `this` bound to a React component that is beneath a React Router match, so that `this.props.location` and `this.context.router` are both defined.

Takes as its argument an object containing _key_: _value_ pairs. It transitions to a URL that is the same as the present one except that the specified query parameters are included -- replacing the same-named parameters if they already exist, and adding new parameters where they do not.

For example, if you are at the URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/users?filters=active.Active&sort=Name
```
and invoke this function as:
```
this.transitionToParams({ query: 'water', sort: 'Email' })
```
The application will transition to the new URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/users?filters=active.Active&sort=Water&query=Email
```
The `filters` query parameter is unaffected (since it was not included in the parameters passed in), the old `sort` value `Name` is replaced by the new value `Email`, and the new parameter `query` is added with the value `water`.

## makeQueryFunction(findAll, queryTemplate, sortMap, filterConfig)

Makes and returns a function, suitable to be used as the `query` param of a stripes-connect resource configuration. The function is itself configured by four parameters, which will vary depending on the module that is using it. It is generally used as follows:
```
static manifest = Object.freeze({
  items: {
    type: 'okapi',
    records: 'items',
    path: 'item-storage/items',
    params: {
      query: makeQueryFunction(
        'materialType=*',
        'materialType="${query}" or barcode="${query}*" or title="${query}*"',
        { 'Material Type': 'materialType' },
        filterConfig
      ),
    },
    staticFallback: { params: {} },
  },
});
```

## makePathFunction(basePath, findAll, queryTemplate, sortMap, filterConfig)

Makes and returns a path-function, suitable to be used as the `path` member of a stripes-connect resource configuration. The function is itself configured by five parameters, which will vary depending on the module that is using it. It is generally used as follows:
```
static manifest = Object.freeze({
  items: {
    type: 'okapi',
    records: 'items',
    path: makePathFunction(
      'item-storage/items',
      'materialType=*',
      'materialType="${query}" or barcode="${query}*" or title="${query}*"',
      { 'Material Type': 'materialType' },
      filterConfig
    ),
    staticFallback: { path: 'item-storage/items' },
  },
});

```
### Parameters

* `basePath` -- the path to the resource to be searched on the Okapi service.
* `findAll` -- a string that can be used to find all records (to be combined with the sort specification when there is no explicit query and no filtering). **Note.** It ought not to be necessary to specify this, as `*` or `cql.allRecords=1` should always work, but our present implementation requires it.
* `queryTemplate` -- a template string from which the main query can be generated by substituting in the query string that the user supplies. All instances of the string `${query}` in the string will be replaced by the user's query string.
* `sortMap` -- an object mapping sort-criterion names as they appear in the UI module's column headings to the names of the corresponding fields in the underlying web-service. When these are identical, no map need be supplied, and the former will be used in the place of the latter.
* `filterConfig` -- the configuration structure that describes the UI module's filter groups, as described in [the `<FilterGroups>` documentation](../lib/FilterGroups/readme.md)
